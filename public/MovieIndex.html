 <h1>The Best Movies of All Time by Cathy</h1>
 <h2>My top three movies</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>Harry Potter Series</h3>
 <p>Harry Potter is an amazing movie series filled with magic and fantasy where good prevails over evil.</p>
 
 <h3>Big</h3>
<p>Big is just so creative and ahead of its time.  It was the first movie to trap an adult in a child's body and Tom Hanks set the bar high.</p>
 
<h3>Charlie's Angels</h3>
 <p>Smart, beautiful, independent women who can be strong and compassionate at the same time.</p>
